\usage{get_cartociudad_location_info(latitude, longitude, year = 2011,

  \item{year}{Reference year; see Details section}
  \item{info.source}{A character vector specifying the APIs to consult. Possible values are "census" and "cadastre"}
}

\details{This function consults administrative information for a point within Spain. Censal information is consulted from a different set of layers, each one corresponding to a different year. Whereas provincial and municipal information is mostly stable, censal districts and sections may be subject to greater changes over the years.

The default value for \code{year}, 2011, corresponds to the last census.}

\value{A list contaning the administrative information for the given point. For \code{info.source = "census"} it contains the province, municipality, censal discrict and censal section codes. For \code{info.source = "cadastre"} it contains the cadastral reference and the url to the spanish cadastre website. }

\references{INE's web service is mostly undocumented and the function has been built by reverse engineering API calls. However, users may want to check the \emph{capabilities} of INEs WMS service at \url{http://goo.gl/aKn3vj}.
