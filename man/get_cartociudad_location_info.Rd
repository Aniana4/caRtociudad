\details{The API this function consults provides administrative information for a point within Spain from a different set of layers, each one corresponding to a different year. Whereas provincial and municipal information is mostly stable, censal districts and sections may be subject to greater changes over the years. 

The default value for \code{year}, 2011, corresponds to the last census.}

\value{A data frame containing the province, municipality, censal discrict and censal section codes for the given point.}

\references{INE's web service is mostly undocumented and the function has been built by reverse engineering API calls. However, users may want to check the \emph{capabilities} of INEs WMS service at \url{http://goo.gl/aKn3vj}.
